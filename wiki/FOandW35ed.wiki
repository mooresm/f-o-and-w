Random Maze Generator:
http://www.charm.net/~shack/java/maze.html

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm
 * Depth-First Search
 * Kruskal's algorithm
 * Prim's algorithm

To begin with, assume that each room of the maze is a 5ft square and that more than one occupant cannot occupy the same square simultaneously

Insert each character at random points in the random maze. The game ends when the first person reaches the exit. Each turn, each character either: 
 a) if the character is in an adjacent square to the exit, the game ends.
 b) moves one square to the left, right or straight ahead (depending on whether there are passageways or walls in those directions) or turns around (if they have arrived at a dead end) 
 c) attacks an adjacent character (what about monsters? traps?)

A more sophisticated game:
movement rate (30ft per round, or double move, 5ft step)
time dilation
 * from realtime (6sec/round) to fast forward (0 delay)
torchlight, lanterns or magic improve visibility
AoO, tumble
party of 4 characters occupies a 10ft square (each room in the random maze is 10ft x 10ft, with doorways 5ft wide...)
 * configurable marching order, eg. mage in the middle, fighters on the front line, rogue scouting ahead, etc.
populate the maze with random monsters and traps (and other dungeon features, eg. difficult terrain) according to the average party level
 * new monsters might wander in from outside

import PCGen characters
http://www.pcgen-test.org/wiki/index.php?title=Building_PCGen
http://www.pcgen-test.org/wiki/index.php?title=MAVEN
 * specify location of PCGen jar file
 * specify location of LST sources, as well as which sources to load into memory

GemRB Game Engine (open source re-implementation of BioWare's Infinity engine, 1998-2002)
 * 2nd edition D&D

support for feats and spellcasting (incl. arcane spell failure)
 * 8h rest to recover spells
hide, move silently
diplomacy, intimidation

save/load maze data file (which includes the inhabitants of the maze)
export maze inhabitant as a PCGen character

AI:
 * select which weapon/feat/spell to use each round, whether to power attack, etc.
 * maze solving algorithm (keeps track of which squares in the maze have already been visited)
 * fight/flight (remember where enemies were last seen?)
 * scout ahead and then run back to the rest of the party when trouble is encountered
 * inventory management (kill it and take its treasure, but must remain unencumbered - pick which armor to wear, etc.)

Inspiration:
 * IdleRPG
 * The Sims
 * D&D: Tiny Adventures
 * Arena of Death
