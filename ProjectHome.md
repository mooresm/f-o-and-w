A turn-based fantasy battle simulation that uses random chance to resolve melee combat between a small number of adversaries.

Based on the revised (v3.5) [System Reference Document](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/article/srd35)

A Zero-Player CRPG (0PCRPG) for those of us who don't have time to play roleplaying games, but would like to pretend that they did!

In the spirit of [Idle RPG](http://idlerpg.net/), [The Sims](http://thesims.ea.com/) and [D&D: Tiny Adventures](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=23415053320).

Think your Epic PC has got what it takes to defeat an entire army, single-handed? Put that theory to the test!

Who has time for PvP? Get some EvE!

Usable by Dungeon Masters as a mass combat simulator.
